= Testing ST7735_TFT_PICO library by Gavin Lyons

== Description
[[description]]

This is here only for testing 1.8" 128x160 TFT display with controller ST7735, SPI.

Original repository: https://github.com/gavinlyonsrepo/ST7735_TFT_PICO

I have imported it to Visual Studio Code project. I changed PICO pin assignements and 
also screen resolution.
