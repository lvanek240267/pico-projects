.Wiring Diagram for Raspberry Pi Pico and ST7735 TFT display. Only 1st display is painted. I have moved 
BMP280 ping to GP12 and GP13, so GP0 ang GP1 is now used for debugging:

* First display:
* GP17 (SPI0 CSn) -> CS
* GP15 -> RST
* GP3 -> RS
* GP19 (SPI0 TX) -> MOSI
* GP18 (SPI0 SCK) -> CLK
* =========================
* Second display:
* GP9 (SPI1 CSn) -> CS
* GP16 -> RST
* GP4 -> RS
* GP11 (SPI1 TX) -> MOSI
* GP10 (SPI1 SCK) -> CLK
* =========================
* BMP280
* SDA -> GP12
* SCL -> GP13
