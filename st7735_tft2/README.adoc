= Testing ST7735_TFT_PICO library by Gavin Lyons

== Description
[[description]]

This is here only for testing two 1.8" 128x160 TFT displays with controller ST7735, SPI.

Original repository: https://github.com/gavinlyonsrepo/ST7735_TFT_PICO

I have imported it to Visual Studio Code project. I changed PICO pin assignements and 
also screen resolution.

* First display:
* GP17 (SPI0 CSn) -> CS
* GP15 -> RST
* GP3 -> RS
* GP19 (SPI0 TX) -> MOSI
* GP18 (SPI0 SCK) -> CLK
* =========================
* Second display:
* GP9 (SPI0 CSn) -> CS
* GP16 -> RST
* GP4 -> RS
* GP11 (SPI0 TX) -> MOSI
* GP10 (SPI0 SCK) -> CLK
