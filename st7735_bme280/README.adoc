.Wiring Diagram for Raspberry Pi Pico, ST7735 TFT displays and BME280 sensors. Only 1st display is painted. I have moved BMP280 pins to GP12 and GP13, so GP0 ang GP1 is now used for debugging:

* First display:
* GP17 (SPI0 CSn) -> CS
* GP15 -> RST
* GP3 -> RS
* GP19 (SPI0 TX) -> MOSI
* GP18 (SPI0 SCK) -> CLK
* =========================
* Second display:
* GP9 (SPI1 CSn) -> CS
* GP16 -> RST
* GP4 -> RS
* GP11 (SPI1 TX) -> MOSI
* GP10 (SPI1 SCK) -> CLK
* =========================
* BME280
* SDA -> GP12
* SCL -> GP13

.Realization on breadboard. There are two BME280 sensors. First one has interrupted pull-ups on I2C, second has changed address to 0x76H.
